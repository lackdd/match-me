# Welcome to Jammer!

My role in this project was back-end but i also did some stuff in the frontend like i set up cloudinary and helped set up chat functionality in the frontend.

Jammer is a full-stack recommendation application to connect users based on their mutual musical interests such as preferred genres, methods to make music, years of experience with music and other biographical data.
